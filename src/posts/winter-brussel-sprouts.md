### Ingredients
- 1 stalk or package of brussel sprouts, washed and halved
- 1 tbs garlic, minced
- 1 tbs balsamic vinegar
- 2  tbs olive oil
- 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts or walnuts, roughly chopped
- 1/3 cup pomegranate seeds

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400F
2. In a large bowl, toss together the brussel sprouts, garlic, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil. 
3. Spread evenly on a baking sheet and place in the oven for 30-40 minutes, or until crispy. 
4. Transfer to serving bowl and sprinkle with toasted nuts, pomegranate seeds, and an optional grating of parmesan cheese. 

#### Tips
- Use white balsamic vinegar to maintain more of the green color in the brussel sprouts! Although the wine-colored shades are nice and rustic as well.
