### Ingredients
- 4 potatoes, I used Yukon Gold, 1/2" cubes
- 1  large leek, chopped
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 Knob of butter, ~2 tbs
- Fresh herb sprigs, I used thyme and rosemary but any fresh herb like oregano, savory, or tarragon will do!
- 1 bay leaf
- 4 cups broth, or enough to cover (I used vegetable, but chicken would also work)
- salt and pepper to taste
- Emeril's Essence creole seasoning and chives to garnish
 
### Directions
1. Melt knob of butter in pot over med-high heat. Add onion and leek and saut√© for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent.
2. Next toss in the garlic, potatoes, and fresh herbs and sautee for 1-2 minutes, until the garlic and herbs are aromatic. 
3. Add the bay leaf and broth, enough to cover, and cook until simmering. Salt and pepper to taste. Turn heat to med-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. 
4. Fish out the bay leaf and herb stems, and add more salt if needed. 
5. Serve as is, or use an immersion blender to achieve a smooth pureed consistency.  

#### Take it to the next level with these tips:
- For a richer, silkier flavor, splurge on the butter. I like to use Kerrygold butter or [Maple View Farms](http://mapleviewfarm.com/) butter (a local dairy our of Hillsborough, NC). 
- Go crazy with the garnishes! I use [Emeril's Essence creole seasoning](https://www.emerils.com/120057/emerils-essence-creole-seasoning) to spice up hearty soups. This seasoning can be found at any grocer/online or you can make it yourself with this recipe. Hint: it lasts for months, so make a pint jar's worth and keep it for those rainy day soups, or any meal for that matter!
- Other garnishes: dots of sour cream, homemade croutons or breadcrumbs, herbs, scallions, etc.
